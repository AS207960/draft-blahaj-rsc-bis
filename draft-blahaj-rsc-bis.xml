    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an update to <xref target="RFC9323"/> to include an explicit purpose and audience for RSCs.
        This alleviates possible security vulnerabilities in the original RSC specification caused by cross-protocol attacks.

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The current version of RPKI Signed Checklists <xref target="RFC9323"/> does not signal the purpose of an RSC,
        nor its intended audience. In the context of processing by humans this is of little concern as the context in
        which e.g. a signed PDF was sent makes its purpose evident. However, in automated machine-to-machine protocols
        these ambiguities can lead to security vulnerabilities. This document updates RSCs to include this information
        to make them suitable for automated processing.
      </t>

          <xref target="BCP14"/> (<xref target="RFC2119"/>, <xref target="RFC8174"/>) when,
          and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

    <section>
      <name>Motivation for update</name>
      <t>Protocols can assign the different meanings to the same data. In the context of human-to-human communication
        the worst outcome of this is often a mere opportunity for a pun; however in the context of automated
        machine-to-machine processing this can lead to serious security vulnerabilities.
      </t>
      <t>An RSC with ambiguous content could, for example, be used in a replay attack. One might argue that a protocol
        which is vulnerable to such a replay attack is a poorly designed one; a counter-argument to this is that it
        should not be possible to design such a vulnerability into a protocol built on top of RSCs.
      </t>
      <t>Further motivation for avoiding such ambiguity in protocols can be found in
        <xref target="ascii-or-protobuf" format="title"/>.</t>

    <section>
      <name>Updates to RSCs</name>
      <t><xref target="RFC9323"/> defines version 0 RSCs; this document defines version 1 RSCs with the following
        modifications.</t>
      <t>The RpkiSignedChecklist sequence is updated to the following:</t>
      <sourcecode type="asn.1">
RpkiSignedChecklist ::= SEQUENCE {
  version [1]           INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  resources             ResourceBlock,
  digestAlgorithm       DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
  checkList             SEQUENCE (SIZE(1..MAX)) OF FileNameAndHash
  purpose               OBJECT IDENTIFIER
  audience              OBJECT IDENTIFIER OPTIONAL }
      </sourcecode>
      <t>Two new fields are defined:</t>
      <dl>
        <dt>purpose</dt>
        <dd>An OID indicating for which purpose this RSC was created. An OID is chosen to avoid potential clashes
          and to allow for easy private extensibility.</dd>
        <dt>audience</dt>
        <dd>An OID indication for whom the RSC was created. It <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be set unless otherwise explicitly
          allowed for by the RSCs purpose, e.g. an RSC intended for general widespread consumption.</dd>
      </dl>
      <t>RSCs with version 0 are still valid, and may still be used, but <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> be used in the
        context of automated processing.</t>
